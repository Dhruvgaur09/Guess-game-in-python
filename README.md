# 🎲 Guess The Number Game (Python)

This is my first GitHub repository! 🚀  
A simple command-line **number guessing game** written in Python.

## 📌 How it works
- The program randomly chooses a number between **1 and 100**.
- The player has to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program gives hints:
  - `"lower number please"` → if your guess is too high.
  - `"higher number please"` → if your guess is too low.
- The game ends when you guess the number correctly.
- Finally, it shows how many attempts you took.

## 🖥️ Run the Game
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python guess_number.py
